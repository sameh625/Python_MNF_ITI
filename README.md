# ITI Full-Stack Training

A structured, day-by-day journey through the web development stack: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Databases/SQL, Python fundamentals, and Django (backend + templating + REST). Each day combines short demos with hands-on tasks and labs. The final project (HeartFund) lives in its own repository; this README focuses on the training path and skills practiced.

## Contents
- Day 01–03: HTML & CSS fundamentals, semantic structure, responsive layouts
- Day 04–08: JavaScript foundations, DOM, events, AJAX, mini apps
- Day 09–12: Databases & SQL, modeling, querying, backups
- Day 13–16: Python syntax, data structures, scripts, small utilities
- Day 17–20: Django framework, models/views/templates, auth, CRUD, REST
- Final Project: HeartFund (separate repo)

## Highlights by Track

### HTML & CSS (Days 1–3)
- Semantic HTML (structure, accessibility mindset)
- Forms and validation basics
- CSS selectors, cascade, layout with Flexbox
- Practical tasks: CV page, multi-page site, styled data views

### JavaScript (Days 4–8)
- Language basics: types, functions, scope, arrays/objects
- DOM manipulation and events
- Fetch/AJAX and simple client-side rendering
- Mini apps: carts, galleries, multi-step tasks with state

### Databases & SQL (Days 9–12)
- Modeling entities and relationships (case studies)
- SELECT/JOIN/AGGREGATE, constraints and indexes (intro)
- Writing and organizing SQL scripts; backup/restore workflow

### Python (Days 13–16)
- Core syntax, functions, modules and file I/O
- Problem solving with scripts and small exercises
- Simple CLI utilities and data processing

### Django (Days 17–20)
- Project/app structure, models, migrations
- Views, templates, static/media files
- Authentication and permissions (intro)
- CRUD flows and REST-style endpoints

## How to Explore This Repo
- Each `Day_XX (...)` folder contains `SessionCode/` (demos) and `Tasks/` (assignments/labs).
- Start from earlier days and progress forward; tasks build on previous concepts.
- Many days include PDFs (agenda/labs) that document objectives and exercises.

## Final Project
The final capstone (HeartFund) is maintained in a dedicated repository and included here as a submodule under `Final_Project/`.

- Repo: https://github.com/sameh625/HeartFund
- Focus areas: full Django app with models, CRUD, media, simple REST and JS front-end.

Note: For full details, setup, and API notes, refer to the project’s own README.

## What I Practiced
- Breaking problems into small tasks and iterating
- Clean, semantic markup and maintainable CSS
- JS-driven UI interactions and data fetching
- Writing, organizing and reasoning about SQL
- Python scripting for automation and exercises
- Building end-to-end Django features (models → views → templates/API)

## Getting Started Locally (Training Folders)
- Open any `SessionCode/` HTML file in a browser to preview UI exercises.
- Run JS demos directly from the corresponding `index.html` pages.
- Review SQL in `DB` days; you can run them against a local RDBMS.
- Python tasks can be executed with `python file.py` in `Python` days.
- Django days include small projects you can run with `python manage.py runserver` after installing dependencies.
